"""Refuse a user-supplied URL that points back inside the network.

Anywhere this app is handed a URL and later fetches it, the user chooses the
destination — so "the internet" is not the only place it can reach. A base URL of
`https://169.254.169.254/` or `https://10.0.0.5:8080/` turns an outbound request into a
read of whatever the container can see that the browser cannot.

Ported from gecko-notes' `_require_safe_external_url` (`backend/app/routers/settings.py`),
which GAM never took — `docs/plan-of-attack.md` records that omission as an M1 gap, and
the unbuilt URL-import endpoint needs this too. Kept at the app root rather than inside
`app/providers/` for that reason: it is not about providers.

Two exceptions are deliberate and live at the call sites, not here:
- Ollama's base URL is allowed to be private. It is a local daemon; that is the point.
- `anthropic` and `deepseek` resolve to fixed managed endpoints, so their stored
  base_url is never fetched at all (see app.providers.endpoints).
