"""The local record of a Gecko Notes account.

GAM does not own identity: Notes signs the token, GAM verifies it. But a verified token
is not a user row, and until one exists GAM knows a `sub` string and nothing else — no
name to show in a header, no record that this person has ever been here, nothing for a
later admin or quota view to count.

So the first time a subject is seen, a shadow row is written from the token's claims.
It is deliberately thin, because the token is thin: gecko-notes signs `{sub, username,
exp}` and nothing more. Anything richer (email, admin) has to come from Notes' own
`/api/auth/session`, which the browser can call directly — doing it server-side would
put a second service on GAM's request path and let Notes being slow make GAM slow.
