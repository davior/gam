"""Engine, session factory and the SQLite pragmas that make concurrent reads work.

Schema changes are Alembic migrations (`alembic/versions/`), not `create_all` and not
a sequence of guarded `ALTER TABLE` statements. gecko-notes took the latter route and
ended up with 650 lines of `try: … except: pass` carrying data backfills, no version
table and no way back — this app starts on the other side of that decision.
