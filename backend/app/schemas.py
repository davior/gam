"""The response envelope every router returns.

Single resources are `{"data": T}` and lists are `{"data": [...], "total", "limit",
"offset"}`. Errors are `{"detail": {"code", "message"}}` — a machine-readable code so
the frontend can branch, and a sentence so it has something to show when it cannot.

Carried over from gecko-notes deliberately: the two frontends then share an error
handler and a client, and neither has to learn a second shape.
