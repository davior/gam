"""Alembic environment.

Two things worth knowing:

- The database URL comes from `app.config.settings`, not `alembic.ini`, so migrations
  and the app can never disagree about which database they mean.
- `render_as_batch=True` is required for SQLite. SQLite cannot ALTER a column or drop a
  constraint; batch mode makes Alembic rebuild the table instead, which is what lets
  this project have real migrations at all rather than append-only columns.
